//! The supporting library for `diffsitter`.
//!
//! This library is not particularly cohesive or well organized. It exists to support the
//! diffsitter binary and I am open to refactoring it and organizing it better if there's demand.
//!
//! In the meantime, buyer beware.
//!
//! All of the methods used to create diffsitter are here and we have attempted to keep the library
//! at least somewhat sane and organized for our own usage.
